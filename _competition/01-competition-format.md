The semi-finals and finals will be held in the Stories Come Alive Room at library@harbourfront. Each team will showcase their story using the interactive, multimedia PowerPoint presentation to a panel of judges. The teams will be given:

- 5 minutes to set up
- 5 minutes storytelling time 
- 3 minutes Q&A with the judging panel *(Note: All team members must be present to answer the judges’ questions.)*

When creating multimedia stories, please adhere to these guidelines:

- Use our Storytelling PowerPoint template when creating multimedia stories and ensure that the visuals/ animation used fall within the parameters of the template. This will ensure that the presentation will be projected properly onto the walls of the Stories Come Alive Room without any distortions. Participants can download the Storytelling template here. 
- Keep the story to a runtime of 5 minutes maximum.
- Participants may deliver their stories in these ways:
-- Record and embed their narration within the PowerPoint slides.
-- Add subtitles. 
-- Tell their story verbally. 
-- Or all of the above. 

*Note: Participants will also need to submit their stories in writing together with their PowerPoint slides at the semi-finals. Each shortlisted team must save these in a thumb drive and submit the thumb drive to the organisers at the start of the semi-finals.*

- Participants may use a few small props and costumes while they showcase their story if they feel this can enhance the experience. But please keep it simple and take note that the story must develop in the PowerPoint slides as the judging panel will be assessing the quality of the digital work and the story’s plot. We are not looking for participants to stage a play or skit and use the PowerPoint slides merely as a stagnant backdrop.
- Participants are given the freedom to be as creative with their stories as they like but please take note that the target audience is young kids aged 3 – 12 so it is best to avoid making the stories too complicated, frightening or violent.
