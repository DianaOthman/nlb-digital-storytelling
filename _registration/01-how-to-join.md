From **3 March – 13 April 2020**, you can register online [here](#){:target="_blank"} . You will also be required to submit a story proposal which should include a synopsis of your story as well as a rough storyboard or samples of the artwork. Do take note to keep the synopsis brief – it should not exceed 250 words. And the entire proposal should not exceed three A4-sized pages. 

These submissions will be assessed and the teams that are shortlisted will be invited to attend complimentary training sessions organised by Microsoft Singapore. At these sessions, participants will be taught how to best employ digital tools such as Paint 3D and PowerPoint to realise their vision and create multimedia stories. They will also be given a tour of the Stories Come Alive Room at library@harbourfront. These sessions will be held sometime in the **week of 4 – 8 May 2020** and teams will be required to register for their preferred date and time slots. Details of the training sessions are yet to be released but do note that slots are limited and will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. 

The training is optional but we do recommend that shortlisted teams attend. An alternative is to learn from these online tutorials:
